## Making Requests to the Live API

You can make requests to the live API hosted at `https://dnamutations.onrender.com`.

### Using `curl` (Unix):

#### Without mutations:

```bash
curl -X POST https://dnamutations.onrender.com/mutation/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"dna":["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATTT","AGACGG","GCGTCA","TCACTG"]}'
```

#### With mutations:

```bash
curl -X POST https://dnamutations.onrender.com/mutation/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"dna":["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATGT","AGAAGG","CCCCTA","TCACTG"]}'
```

### Using PowerShell (Windows):

#### Without mutations:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://dnamutations.onrender.com/mutation/ -Method POST -Body '{"dna":["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATTT","AGACGG","GCGTCA","TCACTG"]}' -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"}
```

**Expected result**

```powershell
hasMutation
-----------
      False
```

### With mutations:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://dnamutations.onrender.com/mutation/ -Method POST -Body '{"dna":["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATGT","AGAAGG","CCCCTA","TCACTG"]}' -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"}
```

**Expected result**

```powershell
hasMutation
-----------
      True
```
